##### Notes

* **EleksTube IPS Clock** is the original model created by the inventor in 2021. There are now many similar designs and clones on the market with varying hardware modifications.

* All "Original EleksTube" clocks sold after July 2022 are "Gen2" versions. Refer to the [Blog post on EleksTube website](https://EleksTube.com/blogs/news/instructions-on-EleksTube-clock-for-gen2-systems) for more details.

* Newer versions from EleksTube, such as PR1 and PR2, Pro and special editions (Pink etc.), are based on the base Gen2 version and sometimes called Gen3, because the original firmware version is already at Version 3.x for them.

* The "basic" version is now officially called "**EleksTube IPS Classic Edition**"

* In 2024, the IPSTube clocks became the cheapest and most widely available "clone" variant of the EleksTube clocks on the market. They are offered by a wide range of sellers and under many different names, but they all have the "IPSTube" logo printed on the front. Most listings include words like Nixie, Tube, Clock, LED, Light, RGB, IPS, and Glow in the description.

* Since 2025, the MarvelTubes Gen2 is a production-cost-reduced variant of the MarvelTubes clock (retail price unchanged) — the MCU was changed from the ESP32-S2 to a standard ESP32 (no PSRAM), and the RTC chip and backup battery were omitted; the time is kept exclusively via NTP.

### 1.3 Purchasing Information

You can buy the "EleksTube IPS Clock" (or its clones) from eBay, Banggood, AliExpress, Amazon, the EleksTube website and other retailers.

Ensure the seller has a good reputation and offers a kind of return guarantee to avoid purchasing fake products or being tricked.

### 1.4 Firmware Compatibility

* This firmware supports and has been tested on various clock models listed above.

* If you discover a new clone or version of these types of clocks, please report it by creating an issue in the "Issues" section of the GitHub project. Provide as many details as possible to help expand compatibility.

### 3.2 Clock specific features

Some clock models have specific functionalities or hardware specials which are only available for that model

#### 3.2.1 NovelLife SE Clock with gesture sensor

* No buttons on the clock, only a gesture sensor

* Gesture sensor is supported by simulating the buttons like the other clocks have

#### 3.2.2 IPSTube Clock - Model H401 and H402

* This model has a 8MB flash memory, so either more clock faces can be stored on the clock or in a better quality (i.e. no palettization/conversion needed) or bigger size of the images.

* Uses a dedicated PlatformIO environment (`IPSTube`) with the `partition_8MB.csv` layout and custom board definition found in `boards/`.

##### 3.2.2.1 One button soft power

* A short press toggles all six displays and the ambient LEDs. The ESP32, Wi-Fi and HTTP server remain running.

##### 3.2.2.2 Color LED stripe

* Some versions of this model have a LED stripe with 28 RGB LEDs installed on the bottom.

##### 3.2.2.3 Dimmable displays

* newer versions (after mid-2024) of the IPSTube clocks can do hardware dimming on the displays and turn off the displays completely

Note: See "Known problems/Limitations" for more info.

#### 3.2.3 MarvelTubes Clock

* Ships with 16MB of flash, allocating a 2MB application slot and a large LittleFS partition so high-resolution or alternate clock faces rarely need recompression.

* Uses an **ESP32-S2-WROVER** module with 16 MB flash and 2 MB PSRAM.

* Hardware PWM dimming for the displays.

* Uses a dedicated PlatformIO environment (`MarvelTubes`) with the `partition_16MB.csv` layout and custom board definition found in `boards/`.

#### 3.2.3b MarvelTubes Gen2 Clock

* Second-generation MarvelTubes clock with a standard **ESP32-WROOM-32E** module (not S2), 16 MB flash, no PSRAM, no RTC.

* Hardware PWM dimming for the displays.

* Uses a dedicated PlatformIO environment (`MarvelTubes_Gen2`) with the `partition_16MB.csv` layout and the custom board definition `esp32devmarveltubesgen2` found in `boards/`.

#### 3.2.4 MarvelTubes Mini Clock

* Compact version of the MarvelTubes clock with 6× **ST7735 80×160 px** IPS TFT displays on individual breakout boards.

* Uses an **ESP32-C3-Mini-1** module with built-in USB Serial/JTAG — no external USB-UART chip (e.g. CH340).

* Chip select lines, display reset and backlight power/dimming are all controlled via an **I2C IO expander** (address `0x19`) — no shift register, no direct GPIO CS.

* Hardware brightness dimming is done through the IO expander register, not via PWM or software alpha blending.

* No RTC or battery is included in the standard kit. Soldering pads for an I2C RTC are present on the PCB but unpopulated — time is kept exclusively via NTP.

* Clock face images are automatically rescaled to 80×160 px during the build process by a pre-build script (`script_prepare_mini_clockfaces.py`).

* Uses a dedicated PlatformIO environment (`MarvelTubesMini`) with the `partition_4MB.csv` layout and the custom board definition `esp32devc3minimarveltubesmini` found in `boards/`.

* Uses a modified version of the `TFT_eSPI` library (stored in `lib/modified_TFT_eSPI`) for ESP32-C3 processor support and correct ST7735 80×160 display offsets.

* Requires `monitor_dtr = 0` and `monitor_rts = 0` in PlatformIO to prevent unintended clock resets when opening or closing the serial monitor (the ESP32-C3 USB-CDC reacts to DTR/RTS signals).

#### 3.2.5 D'Esign Clock

* Custom-designed ESP32-based tube clock with 6× **ST7735S 80×160 px** IPS TFT displays on individual PCBs.

* **No physical buttons** — replaced by two capacitive metal touch rings. Touch detection uses the ESP32 hardware `touchRead()` peripheral.

* Two-ring touch menu: short tap = value change, long press right = next menu item, long press left = exit menu.

* Hardware PWM dimming for the displays.

* Active buzzer on GPIO21 (not used).

* Clock face images are automatically rescaled to 80×160 px during the build process by a pre-build script (`script_prepare_mini_clockfaces.py`).

* Uses a dedicated PlatformIO environment (`DEsign`) with the `partition_4MB.csv` layout.

## 4\. Quick Start - Backup and Pre-Build firmware images

Backup your original firmware and use the pre-built firmware to start with this custom firmware.

### 4.1 Backup first

**Always backup YOUR clocks firmware version as a first step!**

If you mess-up your clock, it's only your fault!

**Note**: **Backup images from other users** normally **DO NOT WORK** as the most original firmware (like from EleksTube) is locked to the MAC address of the ESP32!

For other clocks it MAY work, but don't assume it! Most clocks have MAC address binding!

So again: Do a backup of your original firmware first!

### 4.2 How to do the backup

#### 1) Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver

##### Windows

* On Windows, plug-in the cable into the clock and connect it to an USB port of your PC. Then run Windows Update. It will find and install the driver and generate an virtual COM port.  
    Windows device manager COM port example:  
    ![Windows device manager COM port example](/docs/ImagesMD/WindowsDeviceManagerCOMport.png)

* Only if Windows Update is not working for you, visit the Chinese manufacturer's website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Windows and install them manually.

##### Linux

* On an up-to-date Linux it works out of the box. COM port should be something like `/dev/ttyUSB0`.

* If it is not working, see this [tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-install-ch340-drivers/linux) and see the Chinese manufacturer's website for newest [CH340 driver](https://www.wch-ic.com/downloads/CH341SER_ZIP.html) for Linux.

#### 2) Save your original firmware

To read from (or write to) the clock, it needs to be in the "download mode". Most clocks will go into this mode automatically, when the ESPTool tries to read or write to them. Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable), like the IPSTubes.

##### Windows users

* In the `firmware` subdirectory of this repo you have the `esptool.exe`, which is used to talk to the ESP32 in your clock over the USB-Serial chip on the board of the clock.

* Open Device Manager and find out which virtual COM port represents your clock.

* Modify the backup script that matches your flash size (e.g. `_ESP32 save flash 4MB.cmd`, `_ESP32 save flash 8MB.cmd` for IPSTubes or `_ESP32 save flash 16MB.cmd` for MarvelTubes and MarvelTubes Gen2) with your COM port number.

* Run the CMD file.

* It will generate a file named `backup1.bin`. Rename it and save it to a safe place!

* This is your precious backup!

##### Linux users

* You probably already know where to get `ESPTool` and how to use it. :)

* If not, this guide from the Tasmota project is very easy to follow: [ESPTool](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Esptool/#put-device-in-firmware-upload-mode)

* Adopt the settings for your connected clock and save the firmware file to your device.

### 4.3 Use the pre-built firmware images

If you just want to use this firmware without setting up the development tools, download the latest firmware binary for your clock from the [Releases page](https://github.com/aly-fly/EleksTubeHAX/releases) and flash it using the `_ESP32 write flash.cmd` script in the `firmware` subdirectory.

Alternatively, the `firmware` subdirectory of this repo also contains pre-built firmware images that are updated from time to time.

More info can be found in the `firmware` subdirectory in the [README.MD](firmware/README.md). Like:

* Features enabled in the images

* How to flash the firmware file

If you want more features and configure the firmware, continue reading and check section "How to build this firmware".

### 4.4 Restore backup

You can write back your original firmware by modyfing the file `_ESP32 write flash.cmd`.

* Set correct COM port and the name of your firmware backup file

* If needed, set the size to be written

* Run the CMD file and flash the firmware file

* Check if clock is working

### 4.5 Known backup problems

#### COM port problems

There are a lot of possible issues known with so called "virtual COM ports". Some common ones are listed below.

* On Windows: No COM port at all, but "unknown device" in the device manager -> Try to install the CH340 drivers manually.

* ESPTool fails to read or write all of the firmware -> Check your cable and if possible try another and a shorter one. Try to reduce the baud rate of the connection (like to 115200 or even below). Try to use an external powered USB hub, to avoid under powering.

* ESPTool is giving an error like "device is not in the download mode" -> Try to hold the power button while plugging the USB-C (power) cable. If this doesn't help, you may have a timing problem with the USB-UART chip. This is known for some combinations of USB controllers (especially 3.x) and the CH340. Try to use a USB2.x HUB with external USB power supply or get another COM-port card. If nothing helps, try to use another computer.

For more info ask your favorite search engine or AI Chatbot :)

### 4.6 Lost firmware file

If you lost your original firmware file and wants to restore the original firmware you normally have a problem, because even if you get a backup file from another user, it is locked to the MAC address of the other ESP32 MAC. Under some conditions, it should be possible to change the encoded MAC address in the firmware. This worked for EleksTube Gen1 clocks. See [Issue 8](https://github.com/aly-fly/EleksTubeHAX/issues/8).

Note: There is no guarantee, that you are able to change the MAC address in the firmware file successfully! If the original manufacturer decides to encode the MAC address or hide it, the described method will not work!

So remember: **Always backup your original firmware!**

## 5\. How to build this firmware

Unfortunately, it's not simple plug-and-play. You need to do some things.

These instructions assume you already know how to use the **Visual Studio Code** and the **PlatformIO IDE** extension for it, and just need to know what to do.

### 5.1 Download the code

You're either reading this file after downloading/cloning it already, or you're reading it on GitHub.

If the last point applies, then we assume you can figure out how to get the code from GitHub and put it somewhere on your local machine.

### 5.2 Visual Studio Code & PlatformIO IDE

Follow this guide here: [Install PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)

In short:

* Download, install and run VSCode

* Go to Extensions, search for "PlatformIO IDE" and install it (it will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner). If you don't have Python already installed it will be automatically added by PlatformIO. In case of issues, install Python 3.x manually.

### 5.3 Open the project in Visual Studio Code/PlatformIO

* Start Visual Studio Code (VSC) and select "Open Folder".

* Select the project root `EleksTubeHAX` directory.

* PlatformIO (PIO) will detect the platformio.ini file, open the PlatformIO project, and download all needed packages/libraries.

* If this is not happening automatically, go to the PIO extension tab in VSC and select "Pick a Folder" and then select the `EleksTubeHAX` directory.

#### 5.3.1 ESP32 platform support

The EspressIF 32 development platform for PlatformIO is required to support the ESP32 microcontroller. It will be installed automatically when this project is opened in VSCode/PlatformIO or if the first build is triggered. It will take a while - observe status messages in the bottom right corner.

Tested on version 7.0.1 from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org/platforms/platformio/espressif32).

It is possible that the project also works with ESP32 platform modules from other sources (like Tasmota or PIOArduino), but it is not recommended!

#### 5.3.2 PIO build environment

The PIO build environments for this project are named after each clock (e.g. `EleksTube`) using the board definition of the original "Espressif ESP32 Dev Module" named `esp32dev`.

##### Custom boards

The IPSTube clocks need to use the `IPSTube` environment with a custom board definition named `esp32dev8MB` in the `boards` folder for its 8MB flash hardware and the slower flash chips.
The MarvelTubes clock uses the `MarvelTubes` environment with the custom board definition `esp32devs2marveltubes` for its 16MB flash and ESP32-S2 hardware.
The MarvelTubes Gen2 clock uses the `MarvelTubes_Gen2` environment with the custom board definition `esp32devmarveltubesgen2` for its 16MB flash and standard ESP32-based hardware.
The MarvelTubes Mini clock uses the `MarvelTubesMini` environment with the custom board definition `esp32devc3minimarveltubesmini` for its ESP32-C3-based hardware.
The Xunfeng clock uses the `Xunfeng` environment with the custom board definition `esp32devS2` for its ESP32-S2 hardware.

#### Partition sizes

Flash partition size settings are already configured in the following files.

| filename | environment | flash size | app part size | data part size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `partition_4MB.csv` | All clocks with 4MB flash | 4.0 MB | 1.2 MB | 2.8 MB |
| `partition_8MB.csv` | IPSTube | 8.0 MB | 1.2 MB | 6.8 MB |
| `partition_16MB.csv` | MarvelTubes, MarvelTubes Gen2 | 16.0 MB | 2.0 MB | 13.3 MB |

No OTA partition, one app partition, one data partition as LittleFS to store the images of the clock faces.

These CSV files are used by PlatformIO to create the partitions on the flash of the ESP32 when uploading.

Upload port is set to 921600 baud in the `platformio.ini` file.

**Note**: Some clocks do not support such high speed, if you have issues, reduce this to 460800 baud or even lower.

#### 5.3.3 Libraries in use

All external libraries in use (for details, see the `platformio.ini` file) are automatically installed from the [PlatformIO registry](https://registry.platformio.org) (or their specified source locations). Since no fixed version numbers are set by default in `platformio.ini`, the **most recent versions** are fetched when the project is first opened or before the initial compilation.

* The initial installation may take some time - monitor status messages in the build log screen to see the progress.

* Standard libraries from the frameworks (espressif32 + arduino) are not explicitly listed.

##### 5.3.3.1 Verified Working Versions (as of 2026-06-07)

The project compiles and runs correctly with the library versions listed below. Newer (and possibly older) versions should also work.

If you encounter issues with automatic installation, refer to the comments in `platformio.ini` for troubleshooting.

| dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation | Dushyant Ahuja | 3.0.0 | [https://github.com/dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation](https://github.com/dushyantahuja/IPGeolocation) |

##### 5.3.3.4 Modified Libraries

Some libraries require modifications to work with the specific clock hardware or to implement required functionality.  
The modified versions are stored in the `lib` subdirectory.

| Library | Author | Latest Version | Source Code Link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| sparkfun/SparkFun APDS9960 RGB and Gesture Sensor | SparkFun | 1.4.3 | [https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun\_APDS-9960\_Sensor\_Arduino\_Library](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_APDS-9960_Sensor_Arduino_Library) |
| (not listed in PIO registry) | Marcin Saj | 1.0.7 | [https://github.com/marcinsaj/RTC_RX8025T](https://github.com/marcinsaj/RTC_RX8025T) |
| arduino-libraries/NTPClient | Arduino Libraries | 3.2.1 | [https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/NTPClient) |
| bodmer/TFT\_eSPI (modified) | Bodmer | 2.5.43 | [https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT\_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI) |

**Note:** The modified version of the `SparkFun APDS-9960` library is only required for the NovelLife SE clock (which includes a gesture sensor). It is always compiled **but not linked** for other clock variants.

**Note:** The **MarvelTubes Mini** needs a **modified version of `TFT_eSPI`** stored in `lib/modified_TFT_eSPI/` instead of the standard library fetched from the PlatformIO registry. This modified version is used for **all clock environments** — the standard `bodmer/TFT_eSPI` entry in `platformio.ini` is intentionally commented out. The local modified copy is required for three reasons:

1. **ESP32-C3 processor support** — adds the `TFT_eSPI_ESP32_C3.h` processor file with IDF-level bug fixes (missing definitions, renamed register references) that are not present in the current upstream release (2026-05-02).
2. **ST7735 80×160 display offsets** — correct column offset (`colstart=26`) and row offset (`rowstart=1`) for the `ST7735_GREENTAB160x80` panel variant used in the Mini, preventing image shift on the display.
3. **`User_Setup.h` via build script** — the library is pre-configured by the `script_configure_tft_lib.py` build script, which copies `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h` as `User_Setup.h` into the modified library folder before compilation.

The `MarvelTubesMini` PlatformIO environment, like all other environments, references this local library path automatically via the `lib/` folder; the standard `bodmer/TFT_eSPI` from the PlatformIO registry is disabled.

#### 5.3.4 Configure the `TFT_eSPI` library

The supplied `script_configure_tft_lib.py` automatically takes care of the library configuration. It copies two files (`_USER_DEFINES.h` and `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h`) into the `lib/modified_TFT_eSPI/` subdirectory before building. This makes sure that the modified local `TFT_eSPI` library is initialized with the correct values for each clock type.

If you have issues with the scripts, copy the files manually every time the `TFT_eSPI` library is updated.

### 5.4 Configure, Build and Upload new firmware

Make sure you configured everything for your clock in the `_USER_DEFINES.h` in the `includes` subdirectory:

* Rename/Copy `_USER_DEFINES - empty.h` to `_USER_DEFINES.h`

* Select if you prefer WPS or hardcoded credentials for WiFi (comment '#define WIFI\_USE\_WPS' line and enter your WiFi network credentials to the other lines and uncomment them).

* Select image type for the clock faces to store: Bitmap files (.BMP) or .CLK files (uncomment #define USE\_CLK\_FILES).

Optionally:

* Enable automatic "Night Time Mode" by (uncomment `#define DIMMING` line and also the following which defines the begin and end of the night time).

* Enable integrated MQTT service (uncomment `#define MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED` line and enter your MQTT credentials. From your local broker or from an internet-based broker. E.g. register on [SmartNest.cz](https://www.smartnest.cz/), create a Thermostat device, copy your username, API key and Thermostat Device ID.

* Enable Home Assistant (HA) support by uncomment `#define MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` and the following block of comments for Auto-Discovery in HA (local MQTT Broker is required).

* *NOTE*:
  * Only one MQTT service can be used at once.

* Disable/Change IP-based automatic timezone detection:

  This automatically sets your timezone offset when the clock starts and also detects Daylight Saving time switches.
  `#define GEOLOCATION_ENABLED` is active and IP-API.com is selected as default provider.

  Option 1:
  * IP-API.com (Recommended - No API key required)*
  * Free tier: 45 requests per minute, unlimited total usage
  * No registration required
  * Default provider when `GEOLOCATION_ENABLED` is uncommented
  * Use: `#define GEOLOCATION_PROVIDER_IPAPI` (enabled by default)
  * Leave `GEOLOCATION_API_KEY` empty or use placeholder value

  Option 2:
  * Abstract API (Alternative with API key)
  * Free tier: 1,000 requests total per account (no reset!)
  * Registration required at [Abstract API](https://www.abstractapi.com/)
  * Use: `#define GEOLOCATION_PROVIDER_ABSTRACTAPI`
  * Enter your API key in `GEOLOCATION_API_KEY`
  * **Warning**: Be careful not to exceed the 1,000 request limit!

  Option 3:
  * IPGeolocation.io (Alternative with API key)
  * Free tier: 1,000 requests per month
  * Registration required at [IPGeolocation.io](https://ipgeolocation.io/)
  * Use: `#define GEOLOCATION_PROVIDER_IPGEOLOCATION`
  * Enter your API key in `GEOLOCATION_API_KEY`
  
  *Important Notes:*
  * Only enable ONE provider at a time
  * The clock checks timezone on sunday at 3:00 AM (with retry protection)
  * Failed requests are limited to 4 attempts per day with 5-minute backoff
  * Timezone changes are validated (max 2-hour difference from stored value)

Connect the clock to your computer via a USB cable. You'll see, that a new serial port is detected and showing up in the device configuration. If not, check the section "Install the USB Serial Port Device Driver".

PlatformIO will automatically select the right port for uploading (in most cases).

Most clocks will go into to the download mode automatically, when PlatformIO is trying to upload the built firmware files. Some clocks needs a button pressed while the powering phase (plugging the USB cable), like the IPSTubes.

**Note**: If you have Bluetooth virtual ports on your machine, it might hang and you must manually select the COM port in the `platformio.ini`, see [Upload options](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/sections/env/options/upload/index.html).

#### 5.4.1 Step 1 - Compile the code and upload the firmware file (to the app partition)

Compile the code via the "Build" command of PlatformIO extension for the clock environment you are using (e.g., EleksTube, EleksTube_Gen2, NovelLife, SI\_HAI, PunkCyber, IPSTube, MarvelTubes, MarvelTubes_Gen2, MarvelTubesMini or DEsign) and upload the code via the "Upload" command in the matching environment for your clock.

![PlatformIO Build](/docs/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuild.png)

At this point, it should build cleanly and upload successfully.

Example output from a successful build:

![PlatformIO Build Output](/docs/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildOutput.png)

Example output from a successful upload:

![PlatformIO Upload Output](/docs/ImagesMD/PlatformIOUploadOutput.png)

**Note**: On auto-reset clocks, you'll see the clock boot up after upload. It will go into the setup routine and ask for WPS or connecting to the configured WiFi network. On some clocks, you need to to a manual reset (power off/on cycle).

**Note**: After the initially flash, your clock will **NOT SHOW ANYTHING** on the displays after the setup phase! This is, because it doesn't have any bitmaps to display on the flash memory yet!

**The screens will stay blank until you upload data!**

Continue with the next step to get the clock running.

#### 5.4.2 Step 2 - Fill data partition (LittleFS) with images

The repository comes with a "predefined" set of BMP files in the `data` subdirectory.

Each set of 10 images (one image for each digit) is called a "clock face" and can be chosen from the clock menu. Each set represents normally a different design or 'font' for the clock. See below if you want to make your own.

Note: All files in the `data` subdirectory will be packed into the LittleFS flash image! Make sure to tidy it up. Only the necessary images should be there and `clockfaces.txt` with names of the clock fonts for HA.

##### 5.4.2.1 Generate and upload

* In PlatformIO extension go to "Project Tasks" and expand: EleksTubeHax -> Platform for the clock environment.

* Select "Build Filesystem Image" first.

* Then connect the clock in download mode.

* Click "Upload Filesystem Image".

![PlatformIO Build Filesystem](/docs/ImagesMD/PlatformIOBuildFilesystem.png)

This will upload the files to the LittleFS filesystem on the ESP32 (flash of the clock).

Note: The data will stay there, even if you re-upload the real firmware to the app partition, because the data partition is not overridden or modified by that.

### 5.4.3 Check if clock is working

After Step 2 the clock should boot up and show the boot sequence on all displays. After finishing the boot sequence, the clock should display the actual time with the default clock face.

## 5.5 Create a flashable firmware image

Alternatively to build and uploading the app part and the data part in single steps, you can create a single firmware file, which is flashable all at once to the clock.

You still need to define all the settings/features you want to use in the `USER_DEFINES.h`, especially your clock type.

Additionally, you need to uncomment the line `-D CREATE_FIRMWAREFILE` in the platformio.ini to enable a post-build step, to create the image for your clock.

If you now build the project in PlatformIO via the "Build" command, the normal build will takes place and afterwards, a helper script will call the build for the LittleFS data partition and then merge the existing single files together to one file.

The output file is written to the default output dir of the build. Usually the subdirectory `.pio\build\<environment name>` in the project directory.

The firmware file will be named like `FW_<CLOCKNAME>_<VERSIONNUMBER>.bin` (e.g., `FW_EleksTube_v1.3.5.bin`).

This file can be flashed with the `esptool.exe` with the `write_flash` option.

E.g. assuming you are using the `esptool.exe` in the `firmware` subdirectory and the clock is connected to COM5:

`esptool.exe --chip esp32 --port COM5 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash 0x0000 ..\.pio\build\EleksTube\FW_EleksTube_v1.3.12.bin --erase-all`

### 5.5.1 Helper scripts

#### 5.5.1.1 Unified firmware binary builder (`script_build_unified_binary.py`)

The legacy `script_build_fs_and_merge.py` has been replaced by `script_build_unified_binary.py`. This post-build helper registers two chained PlatformIO actions whenever `CREATE_FIRMWAREFILE` is defined.

First, it launches PlatformIO with the `buildfs` target for the active environment (same result as choosing "Build Filesystem Image" in the GUI) so a fresh `littlefs.bin` lands in the environment's build directory.

Second, it parses the currently selected partition CSV to discover the offsets, gathers the core images (bootloader, partitions, app) and the freshly built filesystem image, and then calls PlatformIO's bundled `tool-esptoolpy` (supporting both `merge-bin` and legacy `merge_bin` syntax) to emit the unified firmware file.

#### 5.5.1.2 Clock face image resizing (`script_prepare_mini_clockfaces.py`)

This pre-build script is automatically executed by PlatformIO before compiling for clock environments that use 80×160 px displays (currently **MarvelTubes Mini** and **D'Esign**). It converts the clock face images in the `data` directory from the standard 135×240 px format used by full-size clocks to the 80×160 px target resolution of the smaller displays.

**How it works:**

1. It scans the `data` directory for all BMP and CLK clock face image files (matching the pattern `<digits>.<bmp|clk>`).
2. Each source image is first centered on a virtual 135×240 px canvas (mirroring the runtime centering behavior of `DrawImage` in `TFTs.cpp`), then the canvas is scaled down to 80×160 px using nearest-neighbor resampling.
3. The background color used to fill the virtual canvas (and any letterbox bars in `contain` mode) is not hardcoded black, but is automatically detected from the source image: the four corner pixels of the original image are sampled and the majority color among them is chosen as the background. This avoids visible seams when the clock face has a non-black border color.
4. Two resize modes are supported (configured via the `RESIZE_MODE` variable at the top of the script):
   * **`contain`** (default) — fits the image within the target dimensions, preserving the aspect ratio. Unused areas are filled with the detected background color.
   * **`crop`** — fills the target completely by cropping equally from both sides of the longer axis (no bars, but edges are cut off).
5. The resized images are written into a separate output directory used by the LittleFS filesystem image builder, so the original source files in `data` are never modified.

Both BMP (including palettized variants) and CLK files are handled. The script requires Python 3 with no additional third-party packages beyond what PlatformIO already provides.

## 5.6 Miscellaneous stuff

### 5.6.1 Custom clock faces from Bitmaps

If you want to change the uploaded clock faces for the clock:

* Create your own set of BMP files or select and copy some from the provided sets in the `assets/other graphics` subdirectory of this repo or download some from the internet (see below).

* Maximum resolution of each image is 135 x 240 pixels (HxW). They can be smaller, then the picture will be centered on the display.

* Maximum color depth is 24 bit RGB. But recommended is palettized Bitmaps with 256 colors palette.

* Name them `10.bmp` (for digit Zero) through `19.bmp` (for digit Nine); `20.bmp` to `29.bmp`, and so on. Note: There is no set 00-09.bmp!

* You can add max 8 clock face sets in the moment (Due to a problem in the detection mechanism).

* If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` subdirectory.

* Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.

Tips:

* Cut away any black border, this only eats away valuable flash storage space! Keep the same height for all images!

* Run your preferred image editor and play with reduced bit depths / palettization and dither of the image!

* Very good results are with Dithering and 256-color palette. Size reduction is approx 70%.

* With very simple images (like 7-segment digits) even 16-color (4-bit) palette is enough and reduces size even further.

### 5.6.2 CLK files as alternative

Before supporting palettized Bitmaps, there was a special format used to store images, to safe some space on the flash of the clock. You can still switch to use CLK (Clock) files only, but there is no space saving anymore, if palettized Bitmaps are used!

To convert existing image files to CLK format:

**Option A — Windows GUI tool** (`\tools\Prepare_images\Convert_BMP_to_CLK.exe`, Windows only):

* Run the tool and select all BMP files to be converted at once. It will create CLK files from them.

**Option B — Python script** (`tools/conv-bmp-to-clk.py`, cross-platform):

* Requires Python 3 with the `Pillow` library (`pip install pillow`).

* Run from the project root, passing the folder that contains your BMP files:

  ```
  python tools/conv-bmp-to-clk.py data
  ```

* By default the converted CLK files are written to a subfolder named `clk` next to the input folder. Use `--out <folder>` to choose a different output location:

  ```
  python tools/conv-bmp-to-clk.py data --out data_clk
  ```

* The script converts all `.bmp` files in the given folder (non-recursive) to RGB565 CLK format and preserves the original filenames.

For both options:

* For a 24-bit depth Bitmap, size reduction is approx 30%.

* If needed, rename the generated files and put them in the `data` subdirectory.

* Then do the "Build Filesystem Image & Upload Filesystem Image" dance again.

Note: It is either Bitmap or CLK! No mixing, so make sure to "clean" the `data` subdirectory before switching.

#### 5.6.3 Download Clock faces

Here are links to some good 3rd party sets out there:

If you have your own clock face that'll work and want it listed here, please file an Issue and/or Pull Request.

#### 5.6.4 Configure your WiFi network

* For WPS: When prompted by the clock, press WPS button on your router (or in web-interface of your router). Clock will automatically connect to the WiFi and save data for future use. No need to input your credentials anywhere in the source code. The clock will remember WiFi connection details even if you unplug the clock.

* Without WPS: Add your WiFi credentials into `_USER_DEFINES.h` file before building the firmware.

Note: The `_USER_DEFINES.h` is included in the default `.gitignore` file, so that your personal credentials will not be pushed to a git repo by default, if you are using a forked git repo. But note, that the credentials can be found as strings in the firmware .BIN file.

### 5.6.5 MQTT and Home Assistant

#### 5.6.5.1 Home Assistant

#### 5.6.5.1.1 Setup

Note: A lot of changes has been made on the HA integration with V1.3.0. User action is requiered to 'migrate' the devices. Detailed information can be found in the section 5.6.5.1.2 "Migration Notes (Home Assistant)".

If you want to integrate the clock into your Home Assistant, you need to make sure, that Home Assistant and the clock uses the same MQTT broker.

Normally you will already have a MQTT broker running locally, which supports the HA discovery and communication messages, like Mosquitto. If not done already, you can set it up easily via an Add-On in HA. See: [Home Assistant MQTT Integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/).

You can also use an internet-based broker which supports "Home Assistant messages" (topics) for discovery and communication, like HiveMQ.

Enable the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` define to have HA support and the belonging `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT_*` defines for auto discovery via the MQTT integration.

After you set up the broker, you need to enter the used IP, port, username and password of it into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section).

After flashing the firmware, the clock will first try connect to the WiFi and then to the given MQTT broker. Check the displays, if a 'NO MQTT' message appears under one of the digits, then the connection was NOT successful and you need to debug why. Hint: use a switch `#define DEBUG_OUTPUT_MQTT` to get detailed debug messages on the serial port of the clock.

If the connection was successful the clock sends the discovery messages for HA and the device should be visible in the MQTT integration.

Note: If you change your used clock faces in the `data` subdirectory, the `clockfaces.txt` in the `data` subdirectory needs to be changed too. This is, because the shown names in HA for the clock faces under "Main light" are hard coded and read from there.

No manual `MQTT_CLIENT` define is needed. The firmware now auto‑generates a stable, lower‑case device identifier from hardware data (MAC/model) and uses the namespace pattern `elekstubehax/<device_id>/...`. Ignore older documentation references instructing you to set `MQTT_CLIENT`.

Note: For using smartnest.cz, define `MQTT_CLIENT_ID_FOR_SMARTNEST` (previously referred to as `MQTT_CLIENT`) to match the external service's required fixed device ID. This becomes the root of the published topics expected by that service.

Note: If you want to use an internet-based broker, you can use HiveMQ. You will need to create an account there and set it up in HA and in here. 'MQTT\_USE\_TLS' must be defined, because HiveMQ only supports encrypted connections. The HiveMQ TLS cert is based on the root CA of Let's Encrypt, so you also need to copy the 'mqtt-ca-root.pem' file from the `data/other graphics` subdirectory into the `data` subdirectory of the PIO project and upload the data partition (file system) with the changed app partition. Other brokers or your locally used cert for your MQTT broker may need another root CA to be set. See: [Connect HA to HiveMQ](https://www.hivemq.com/blog/connect-home-assistant-to-hivemq-cloud/).

Note: If you use Mosquitto and want to separate the permissions on the topics or experience access problems in the logs, you need to set the ACLs manually for it! Commands for it:
user <your_mqtt_username>
topic read homeassistant/status
pattern readwrite elekstubehax/%c/#
pattern readwrite homeassistant/+/%c/#

#### 5.6.5.1.2 Migration Notes (Home Assistant)

This section centralizes all earlier inline migration notes previously shown in other subsections.

Summary:

| Change | What Changed | Action Needed | Impact If Ignored |
| ------ | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| New device ID | `device.identifiers`, `unique_id`, and related values are now constructed from the device model plus the last three tuples of the MAC address | Delete old entities and retained discovery topics. Adjust all HA references (Dashboards, Automations, etc.) to the new IDs | Old entities remain orphaned; dashboards show invalid cards; automations may fail |
| New topics for status messages | All runtime status topics are namespaced under `elekstubehax/` with per‑device subtopics using the lower‑case `device_id` | Delete old retained status topics if present (to avoid confusion) | You may see stale/unused topics alongside the new ones |
| New topics for discovery messages | Exactly one discovery config per device and HA domain (light, number, switch) using the lower‑case `device_id` path | Delete old ghost entities and their retained discovery topics | Old entities remain orphaned and can reappear from retained configs |
| Optional device name suffix | Plain `Model Name` vs. `Model Name (ABCDEF)` when `ENABLE_HA_DEVICE_NAME_SUFFIX` defined | None (opt‑in). To see new/removed suffix immediately, clear retained discovery topics | HA may show old cached name until refresh |

Details:

1. New device ID format and separator change:
  The firmware now constructs a stable `device_id` from the model name plus the last three MAC‑address bytes (example: `elekstube-1a2b3c`). Discovery `unique_id`/`object_id` use underscores instead of slashes (e.g., `myclock123_front` instead of `myclock123/front`). Home Assistant treats changed `unique_id` values as new entities. After flashing a version with this scheme, delete obsolete entities in HA (Settings → Devices & Services → MQTT → device → three‑dot menu → Delete) and remove their retained discovery config topics so they do not reappear.

2. New topics for status messages:
  All runtime (non‑discovery) topics are published under the root `elekstubehax/<device_id>/...` using the lower‑case `device_id`. This yields unique, per‑device status and command channels (for example: `elekstubehax/elekstube-1a2b3c/front` and `/front/set`). If you previously subscribed to older topic paths, update any external scripts/dashboards. Consider deleting old retained status topics to avoid confusion when browsing.

3. New topics for discovery messages:
  Each device now publishes exactly one discovery config per HA domain (light, number, switch) under the path `homeassistant/<domain>/elekstubehax/<device_id>/<entity>/config`. Paths include the lower‑case `device_id`. If retained configs from older paths exist, delete them to prevent ghost entities from reappearing in HA after restarts.

4. Optional device name suffix (cosmetic):
  By default the firmware publishes the plain hardware model in `device.name` (e.g., `EleksTube IPS Tube Clock`). Defining `ENABLE_HA_DEVICE_NAME_SUFFIX` appends a short identifier `(XXYYZZ)` built from the last three MAC bytes, e.g., `EleksTube IPS Tube Clock (3A4FBC)`. `device.identifiers` and all entity `unique_id` values remain unchanged. Use the suffix only if you run several identical clocks and want quick visual disambiguation.

5. Cached device.name after toggling the suffix:
  HA may cache the previous device name until it processes an updated retained discovery message. If you add or remove the suffix flag and want the UI updated immediately, follow the refresh procedure below.

6. General refresh procedure:
  a. Power off / disconnect MQTT for the clock.
  b. Delete all (old) retained discovery config topics for that device:
    like `homeassistant/light/<device_id>/main/config` or `homeassistant/light/<device_id>_main`, `.../back/config` or `..._back/config`, corresponding `homeassistant/switch/...` and `homeassistant/number/...` topics.  
  c. Flash the Firmware with the new MQTT implementation (>1.2.x)
  d. Power the device back on; it publishes the discovery.
  e. Verify in HA device list.
  f. Delete the references to the old device in HA or change them to the new ones.

##### 5.6.4.1.2 Used integrations

Interactions between the firmware of the clock and Home Assistant is done as described in the MQTT integration documentation (see below).

By default, the clock sends auto-discovery messages, and all its entities will be detected by the MQTT integration without user intervention.

The clock is discoverd as two lights (Main and Back) and some other entities (i.e. a switch) as Configuration. The last one is needed to be able to switch the settings of the clock.

See the HA MQTT documentation for details of the used MQTT integrations:

* [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery)

* [MQTT Light integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/)

* [MQTT Switch integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch.mqtt/)

* [MQTT Number integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/number.mqtt/)

##### 5.6.4.1.3 Usage

After a successful auto discovery, you will find a new device under "Setting -> Devices and Services -> MQTT -> XX devices", named after the auto‑generated device id (the same lower‑case identifier visible in the MQTT topic paths). A manual `MQTT_CLIENT` define is NOT required for Home Assistant integration.

![HA MQTT Integration Overview](/docs/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationOverview.png)

If you go into the device details it should look like this:

![HA MQTT Integration Details](/docs/ImagesMD/HAMQTTIntegrationDetails.png)

You can now use this device on your HA dashboards.

The main light represents the displays of the clock, the back light the LED ambient lights.

Each one is dimmable, can be turned on and off and for the 'main light', the clock faces are switchable via "Effect".

![HA MQTT Main Light Details](/docs/ImagesMD/HAMQTTMainLightDetails.png)

For the 'back light', the LED colour and mode can be set.

![HA MQTT Back Light Details](/docs/ImagesMD/HAMQTTBackLightDetails.png)

The settings for the LED modes and the general clock settings can only be set from the "Configuration" entity.

#### 5.6.4.1.4 MQTT Discovery, Topic Layout and Naming Conventions

This firmware supports automated entity creation in Home Assistant via the MQTT Discovery mechanism. All topics follow a consistent, lower‑case namespace to avoid duplication caused by case changes and to simplify manual scripting.

Key principles:

- Root namespace for all runtime state and commands: `elekstubehax`
- Per‑device path segment: lower‑cased unique device name – referred to as `device_id`. Format: `<model>-<XXYYZZ>` where `<model>` is the compile‑time `DEVICE_NAME` (e.g., `elekstube`, `elekstubegen2`, `ipstube`, `novellife`, `punkcyber`, `sihai`, `xunfeng`) and `<XXYYZZ>` are the last three bytes of the ESP32 MAC address in hexadecimal (bytes 3–5 of the canonical MAC). Example: `elekstube-1a2b3c`. This keeps IDs short while remaining sufficiently unique for typical home deployments.
- Entity channel/topic keyword ("main", "back", "use_twelve_hours", "blank_zero_hours", "pulse_bpm", "breath_bpm", "rainbow_duration") – referred to as `entity_id`
- Discovery identifiers (`unique_id` and `object_id`) now use underscore separators: `<device_id>_<entity_id>` (no slashes)
- All state, attribute and command topics are JSON where applicable (schema `json` for lights) or key/value JSON for switches and numbers

Topic patterns (runtime):

```text
Availability:         elektstubehax/<device_id>/alive
Light (main) state:   elektstubehax/<device_id>/main
Light (main) cmd:     elektstubehax/<device_id>/main/set
Light (back) state:   elektstubehax/<device_id>/back
Light (back) cmd:     elektstubehax/<device_id>/back/set
Switch 12h state:     elektstubehax/<device_id>/use_twelve_hours
Switch 12h cmd:       elektstubehax/<device_id>/use_twelve_hours/set
Switch blank0 state:  elektstubehax/<device_id>/blank_zero_hours
Switch blank0 cmd:    elektstubehax/<device_id>/blank_zero_hours/set
Number pulse state:   elektstubehax/<device_id>/pulse_bpm
Number pulse cmd:     elektstubehax/<device_id>/pulse_bpm/set
Number breath state:  elektstubehax/<device_id>/breath_bpm
Number breath cmd:    elektstubehax/<device_id>/breath_bpm/set
Number rainbow state: elektstubehax/<device_id>/rainbow_duration
Number rainbow cmd:   elektstubehax/<device_id>/rainbow_duration/set
```

Discovery topics (published once per entity or after HA restart):

```text
homeassistant/light/<device_id>/main/config
homeassistant/light/<device_id>/back/config
homeassistant/switch/<device_id>/use_twelve_hours/config
homeassistant/switch/<device_id>/blank_zero_hours/config
homeassistant/number/<device_id>/pulse_bpm/config
homeassistant/number/<device_id>/breath_bpm/config
homeassistant/number/<device_id>/rainbow_duration/config
```

Example discovery payload (front light) – abbreviated:

```json
{
  "unique_id": "elekstube-1a2b3c_main",
  "object_id": "elekstube-1a2b3c_main",
  "name": "Main",
  "schema": "json",
  "availability_topic": "elekstubehax/elekstube-1a2b3c/alive",
  "state_topic": "elekstubehax/elekstube-1a2b3c/main",
  "json_attributes_topic": "elekstubehax/elekstube-1a2b3c/main",
  "command_topic": "elekstubehax/elekstube-1a2b3c/main/set",
  "supported_color_modes": ["brightness"],
  "brightness": true,
  "effect": true,
  "effect_list": ["ClockFace1", "ClockFace2", "…"],
  "device": {
  "identifiers": ["EleksTube-1A2B3C"],
    "manufacturer": "EleksTubeHAX",
    "model": "IPS Clock",
    "sw_version": "<firmware-version>"
  }
}
```

Switch command payload examples:

```json
{"state":"ON"}
```

```json
{"state":"OFF"}
```

Number command payload example (pulse speed 75):

```json
{"state":75}
```

Light (front/back) command payload examples (subset):

```jsonc
// Turn front display off
{"state":"OFF"}

// Set brightness (0..255 for front, 0..255 for back) and effect
{"state":"ON","brightness":180,"effect":"Rainbow"}

// Set static backlight color (hs mode) + brightness
{"state":"ON","color":{"h":210,"s":100},"brightness":150,"effect":"Constant"}
```

Effects:

* Front light: effect list equals available clock faces.
* Back light: effect list equals firmware‑defined patterns (Dark/Test/Constant/Pulse/Breath/Rainbow etc.).

Entity summary:

| Entity | HA Domain | Purpose |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| front  | light     | LCD tubes (brightness + clock face as effect) |
| back   | light     | Ambient LEDs (brightness, color HS, effects) |
| 12hr   | switch    | 12/24 hour mode toggle |
| blank0 | switch    | Blank leading zero of hour |
| pulse  | number    | Pulse effect BPM (20–120) |
| breath | number    | Breath effect BPM (5–60) |
| rainbow| number    | Rainbow cycle duration seconds (0.2–10) |

Migration note (important): Prior firmware versions used slash separators in `unique_id` / `object_id` (e.g., `myclock123/front`). Home Assistant treats a changed `unique_id` as a brand‑new entity; the old one will remain in the entity registry until manually removed. If you previously had entities with the old format, you can safely delete the obsolete entries in Home Assistant (Settings → Devices & Services → MQTT → device → three‑dot menu → Delete) after the new ones appear.

Automation tips:

- Use `availability_topic` to gate automations (`state == 'online'`).
- Prefer referencing entities via their entity_id instead of hardcoding MQTT topics when working inside Home Assistant.
- For external scripts, build topics exactly as documented to avoid mismatches after firmware updates.

If you disable Home Assistant support (`MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` not defined), discovery messages are not sent, but plain MQTT state/command topics stay available (if `MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED` is defined). See also next chapter.

#### 5.6.5.2 MQTT without Home Assistant

##### 5.6.5.2.1 Setup

If the `MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT` is not enabled, but `MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED` is, the MQTT support is limited. This is mostly intended to work with [SmartNest.cz](https://www.smartnest.cz/) service, which is a simple user interface. It can be extended / integrated with Google assistant, Alexa or SmartThings.

The actual MQTT implementation is reacting to control commands of an emulated temperature controller, so you can use the temperature setpoint to change clock faces and on/off function to control the clock.

You will need to create an account, set up the device there and get the ID of it; and fill in the data into the matching `MQTT_*` defines in your `_USER_DEFINES.h` (MQTT config section).

Important: Uncomment and define `MQTT_CLIENT_ID_FOR_SMARTNEST` or the topic is not correct for smartnest.cz.

Note: If you want to use encrypted connection to your broker, you need to enable 'MQTT\_USE\_TLS' and copy a valid root CA cert file to the `data` subdirectory. See the notes under the HA section for HiveMQ above.

#### 5.6.5.3 Debugging MQTT

Further analysis or debugging problems with the MQTT code is easier to perform using a MQTT message reader tool, for example, "MQTT Explorer", a common HA Add-On for users, who prefer manual configuration. See [HA forum post for MQTT Explorer Add-On](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/addon-mqtt-explorer-new-version/603739).

Note: It can be also used as a stand-alone application. See [Homepage of MQTT Explorer project](https://mqtt-explorer.com/).

You need to connect to the same MQTT broker like the clock and then will be able to see the messages from the clock and send them.

All MQTT messages from and to the clock are also traced out via the serial interface. So using a serial monitor while using the clock, gives also debug information. Make sure you enable the `DEBUG_OUTPUT_MQTT` before compilation and upload.

### 5.7 IPSTube Codex status integration (macOS)

This integration is **not installed automatically** by cloning the repository or starting Codex. Each Mac needs a one-time manual installation because the files live in the user's global Codex and LaunchAgent directories, outside this repository. After installation, Codex runs the hooks automatically and macOS starts the focus watcher automatically at login.

The current implementation is macOS-only. It uses `fcntl`, `/usr/bin/curl`, `/usr/bin/lsappinfo`, and a user LaunchAgent. Do not install it unchanged on Windows or Linux.

#### 5.7.1 What the integration does

| State | Codex event or condition | Screen 0 | Ambient light | Image fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INIT / IDLE | `SessionStart`, or Codex becomes frontmost after DONE | dynamic image 249 | rainbow | image 251 |
| WORK | `UserPromptSubmit` or `PostToolUse` | `matrix` | rainbow | image 252 |
| WAIT | `PermissionRequest` | `swirl` | orange `#FF8000` pulse | image 253 |
| DONE | `Stop` | `squares` | green `#00FF00` breath | image 254 |

Animation requests use the image fallback only when the animation API fails. Returning to Codex after DONE changes the display to IDLE within about one second. The focus watcher detects the Codex application (`com.openai.codex`), not an individual Codex task window.

The dynamic IDLE image is generated on the Mac from `data/251.bmp`. It moves the black-hole artwork upward, removes the `IDLE` label, and adds a rounded weekly-allowance progress bar plus a line such as `98% 07-29`. The percentage is the remaining weekly Codex allowance and the date is its local reset date. The watcher refreshes the data every five minutes only while the integration is in IDLE state, and uploads image 249 only when its BMP content changes. If Codex usage lookup, rendering, or upload fails, image 251 remains the offline fallback.

The watcher reads structured data from the local Codex app-server method `account/rateLimits/read` and selects the window whose duration is exactly 10,080 minutes. It does not scrape `/usage` output or call a private ChatGPT HTTP endpoint. The renderer uses only the Python standard library.

The clock must run an IPSTube firmware build that exposes `/api/display`, `/api/animation`, and `/api/backlight` and includes the `matrix`, `swirl`, and `squares` presets. Build it with:

```bash
pio run -e IPSTube
```

The combined 8 MB image is written to `firmware/FW_IPSTube_v1.3.13.bin` and must be flashed at offset `0x0`.

#### 5.7.2 Source files

Keep these repository files as the version-controlled source of truth:

- `tools/codex_ipstube_status.py` — lifecycle hook and focus-watcher logic.
- `tools/codex_ipstube_hooks.example.json` — global Codex hook definitions.
- `tools/com.zero.codex-ipstube-focus.plist` — macOS user LaunchAgent.
- `data/251.bmp` — source artwork copied beside the installed hook as its IDLE template.

The installed copies do not depend on the repository after installation.

#### 5.7.3 Agent installation checklist

An agent performing this setup must run as the logged-in macOS user, not as root. It must inspect and preserve any existing `~/.codex/hooks.json`; never replace unrelated hooks.

1. Confirm that the clock is reachable from the Mac.

   ```bash
   curl -sS --max-time 5 http://ipstube.local/api/config
   ```

2. Review the per-machine settings before copying files.

   | Setting | Repository default | Notes |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | `IPSTUBE_URL` | `http://ipstube.local` | A stable IP address such as `http://192.168.2.202` can be used if `.local` resolution is unreliable. |
   | `IPSTUBE_PROXY` | `socks5h://127.0.0.1:3070` | Set it to an empty string when no proxy is required. The proxy must be able to reach the local clock. |
   | `IPSTUBE_STATUS_SCREEN` | `0` | Valid values are 0 through 5. Screen 0 is the MANUAL status screen in the repository's reversed default layout. |
   | `IPSTUBE_IDLE_REFRESH_SECONDS` | `300` | Usage refresh interval while IDLE; values below 60 seconds are clamped to 60. |
   | `CODEX_APP_SERVER` | Desktop-bundled Codex, then PATH fallback | Optional absolute path to a compatible `codex` executable. |
   | `IPSTUBE_IDLE_TEMPLATE` | Template beside the installed hook | Optional absolute path to another uncompressed 135x240 8-bit BMP. |

3. Install the hook script into the global Codex directory.

   Run these commands from the repository root:

   ```bash
   CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
   mkdir -p "$CODEX_HOME/hooks"
   install -m 755 tools/codex_ipstube_status.py "$CODEX_HOME/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py"
   install -m 644 data/251.bmp "$CODEX_HOME/hooks/codex_ipstube_idle_template.bmp"
   ```

4. Install or merge the global hook definitions.

   - If `$CODEX_HOME/hooks.json` does not exist, copy `tools/codex_ipstube_hooks.example.json` to it.
   - If it already exists, merge the five event arrays under the top-level `hooks` object: `SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PermissionRequest`, `PostToolUse`, and `Stop`.
   - Preserve all unrelated events and handlers.
   - Do not add the same IPSTube handler twice when repeating the installation.

   The installed command should use the global script, not a path inside this repository:

   ```text
   /usr/bin/python3 ~/.codex/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py
   ```

   When this Mac needs settings different from the repository defaults, prefix every installed hook command with the same environment values. For example, a direct IP connection without a proxy is:

   ```text
   IPSTUBE_URL=http://192.168.2.202 IPSTUBE_PROXY='' IPSTUBE_STATUS_SCREEN=0 /usr/bin/python3 ~/.codex/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py
   ```

5. Install the focus watcher LaunchAgent.

   ```bash
   CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
   PLIST="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/com.zero.codex-ipstube-focus.plist"
   mkdir -p "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents"
   install -m 644 tools/com.zero.codex-ipstube-focus.plist "$PLIST"
   plutil -replace ProgramArguments.1 -string "$CODEX_HOME/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py" "$PLIST"
   plutil -lint "$PLIST"
   ```

   The repository plist contains `/Users/zero/.codex/...` because launchd does not expand `~` in `ProgramArguments`. The `plutil` command above replaces it with the current user's absolute path.

   If custom network settings were added to the hook commands, add the same settings to the copied plist before loading it:

   ```xml
   <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
   <dict>
     <key>IPSTUBE_URL</key>
     <string>http://192.168.2.202</string>
     <key>IPSTUBE_PROXY</key>
     <string></string>
     <key>IPSTUBE_STATUS_SCREEN</key>
     <string>0</string>
   </dict>
   ```

6. Load or reload the LaunchAgent.

   ```bash
   USER_DOMAIN="gui/$(id -u)"
   LABEL="com.zero.codex-ipstube-focus"
   PLIST="$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/$LABEL.plist"
   launchctl bootout "$USER_DOMAIN/$LABEL" 2>/dev/null || true
   launchctl bootstrap "$USER_DOMAIN" "$PLIST"
   launchctl kickstart -k "$USER_DOMAIN/$LABEL"
   launchctl print "$USER_DOMAIN/$LABEL"
   ```

   A healthy service reports `state = running`. Its diagnostic log is `/tmp/codex-ipstube-focus.log`.

7. Restart Codex and trust the hooks.

   Open `/hooks` in the Codex CLI, review the five new or changed handlers, and select **Trust all and continue**. Codex skips non-managed command hooks until their exact definitions are trusted. If the Desktop app does not expose `/hooks`, run the installed `codex` CLI or the CLI bundled inside the Desktop app, complete the trust flow there, and then restart the Desktop app.

#### 5.7.4 Verification

Verify the script independently before relying on lifecycle events:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
printf '%s' '{"hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit"}' | \
  /usr/bin/python3 "$CODEX_HOME/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py"
curl -sS --max-time 5 http://ipstube.local/api/config
```

The status screen should report `animation: "matrix"` and the backlight should report `effect: "rainbow"`. To test WAIT, send `PermissionRequest`; it should report `animation: "swirl"`, `effect: "pulse"`, and color `#FF8000`.

Test the dynamic IDLE image separately:

```bash
CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
/usr/bin/python3 "$CODEX_HOME/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py" --refresh-idle
curl -sS --max-time 5 http://ipstube.local/api/config
```

On success, screen 0 reports image 249 and displays the rounded remaining-usage bar and the percentage/reset-date line. If it reports image 251 instead, check the LaunchAgent log, confirm the template was installed, and verify that the Desktop-bundled `codex app-server` starts under the logged-in user.

Then create a new Codex task and confirm the real lifecycle sequence. If the device does not change:

1. Run `/hooks` and confirm every installed handler is `Active`.
2. Check `/tmp/codex-ipstube-focus.log`.
3. Run the script manually with the exact environment values from `hooks.json`.
4. Query `/api/config` to distinguish a hook failure from a physical screen-mapping problem.

#### 5.7.5 Updating or uninstalling

To update, reinstall both `tools/codex_ipstube_status.py` and `data/251.bmp` over their global copies and restart the LaunchAgent. Replacing only the script does not change the hook command definition. If `hooks.json` or a command string changes, open `/hooks` and trust the new definition again.

To uninstall:

```bash
USER_DOMAIN="gui/$(id -u)"
LABEL="com.zero.codex-ipstube-focus"
launchctl bootout "$USER_DOMAIN/$LABEL" 2>/dev/null || true
rm -f "$HOME/Library/LaunchAgents/$LABEL.plist"
rm -f "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/hooks/codex_ipstube_status.py"
rm -f "${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/hooks/codex_ipstube_idle_template.bmp"
```

Finally, remove only the IPSTube handlers from `~/.codex/hooks.json`; preserve all other global hooks.

## 6\. Known problems/limitations, Notes

##### 6.1 Precision of the gesture sensor (NovelLife SE)

The accuracy of the gesture sensor on the Novellife clock is not very good. It needs some 'training' to be able to control the clock.

The defined gestures and there button equivalents are:

| gesture | button |
| --- | --- |
| down, near | Power |
| up, far | Mode |
| left | Left |
| right | Right |

* The movement of the finger/hand from behind the glass tubes of the watch, over the glass tubes, directly and closely over the sensor to the front of the watch is the “down” gesture.

* The movement of the finger/hand from in front of the watch, directly and closely over the sensor, further over the glass tubes and behind it is the “up” gesture.

* The movement of the finger/hand starting left side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the right side is the “right” gesture.

* The movement of the finger/hand starting right side from the sensor and moving over the sensor to the left side is the “left” gesture.

* Moving the finger/hand from directly above the sensor (from 5-8 cm away) toward the sensor (up to about 1 cm away) is the “near” gesture.

* Moving from close by the sensor (coming from the front and putting the finger/hand in 1cm distance over the sensor) to a bit more far away (5-7cm distance) is the "far" gesture.

##### 6.2 One button soft power for IPSTube clocks

The IPSTube clock has one rear button. A short press toggles the six displays and ambient LEDs off or on. This is a soft-power action: the ESP32, Wi-Fi and HTTP server remain running, and the off state is not saved across a reboot.

On boards fitted with transistor Q1 this controls the display ground/power path and reduces heat. Boards without Q1 can only display black while their LCD electronics remain powered, so the temperature reduction is limited.

##### 6.3 No real display turn-off or dimming for some IPSTube clocks

Depending on the board version (PCB revision) of the IPSTube models (H401 and H402), transistor Q1 may or may not be present on the board.

* If the transistor is present, the displays can be fully turned on and off like on other clocks, and hardware dimming is possible.

* If the transistor is not present, the TFT LCDs cannot be turned on or off via software without modifying the hardware. Only software dimming (alpha blending) is available.

It seems that only the early versions of the clocks lack the transistor. All versions seen after mid-2024 appear to have it.

By default, the code assumes that the transistor is present and that the displays are dimmable. This will not damage your clock, even if the transistor is missing, but display dimming will be completely disabled!

If the dimming is not working with your clock, you need to uncomment `-D HARDWAREMOD_IPSTUBE_CLOCK_WITHOUT_DIMMING_TRANSISTOR` in `platformio.ini` and rebuild and upload the firmware.

See also the code comments for more info in the `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h` for the IPSTubes.

##### 6.4 Slow digit refresh times for IPSTube clocks

IPSTube clocks use slower Winbond flash chips that require conservative SPI settings (DIO mode at 40 MHz instead of QIO at 80 MHz). These slower flash chips provide only half the throughput of standard ESP32 flash memory, which results in slower loading times for the high-quality digit images and therefore slower display refresh rates compared to other clock models. Additionally, attempting to use QIO mode (quad I/O with four data lines which ARE connected on the PCB) or higher frequencies like 80 MHz (DIO or QIO) causes system instability with these chips.

In normal operation this is barely noticeable, but becomes very apparent when multiple different digits need to be drawn simultaneously (cold load without prefetch).

##### 6.5 LED strip on the bottom for some IPSTube clocks

Some versions of the IPSTubes have a LED stripe with 28 RGB LEDs installed on the bottom.

* The strip extends the six LEDs at the bottom of the LCDs, known as the "backlight".

* Currently, the strip follows the backlight configuration (modes, colors, etc.).

* All models have a 3-pin socket on the board, so theoretically, the strip can be retrofitted using any WS2812B-based LED strip with some modifications. However, the recess in the metal cover is missing, preventing the light from shining through.

* By default, only six LEDs are set. To enable the full LED strip, uncomment `-D HARDWAREMOD_IPSTUBE_CLOCK_WITH_LED_STRIPE` in `platformio.ini` and rebuild and upload the firmware.

##### 6.6 Xunfeng clocks

The CyberPunk clocks identify themselves as "Xunfeng" when they start up with the original firmware. This suggests that the Xunfeng clock with the S2 chip and the CyberPunk clocks are made by the same company.

##### 6.7 MarvelTubes: Missing WiFi antenna (UE module variant)

Some MarvelTubes clocks are shipped with an **ESP32-S2 UE** module (the variant with an external antenna connector, U.FL/IPEX) instead of the standard module with a built-in PCB trace antenna. These clocks are delivered **without an antenna plugged in**, so the WiFi signal is extremely weak or completely unusable out of the box.

If your MarvelTubes clock suffers from frequent WiFi disconnects or fails to connect at all, check whether the ESP32 module on the PCB has a small U.FL/IPEX coaxial connector socket. If it does, no antenna is attached.

**Solution**: Purchase a suitable **IPEX (U.FL) WiFi antenna**. A flat/ribbon (FPC) antenna is recommended because it is thin enough to be routed and tucked inside the housing without requiring any case modification. Simply plug the antenna into the U.FL socket on the module.

Without an antenna, expect very unreliable WiFi — repeated disconnects, failed NTP sync and MQTT dropouts are typical symptoms.

##### 6.8 D'Esign clock: Two-ring touch menu operation

The D'Esign clock has **no physical buttons**. Instead, two capacitive metal touch rings on the front act as left and right inputs using the ESP32 hardware `touchRead()` peripheral.

Because there are only two inputs, the menu works differently from clocks with four buttons (Power, Mode, Left, Right):

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Any short tap **release** (while clock is idle) | Opens the menu and jumps to the first menu item |
| **LEFT** short tap | Decrements / changes the current value one step to the left |
| **RIGHT** short tap | Increments / changes the current value one step to the right |
| **RIGHT** long press (≥ 500 ms) | Advances to the next menu item |
| **LEFT** long press (≥ 500 ms) while **in menu** | Exits the menu and returns to normal clock display |
| **LEFT** long press (≥ 500 ms) while **idle** | Toggles displays and backlight on/off |
| No interaction for a few seconds | Menu times out and closes automatically |

**Tips**:

* The menu opens on **release** of a short tap, not on press. This is intentional: it allows a LEFT long press (which fires after 500 ms, before any release event) to toggle display power without the menu ever opening. A long press releases via a distinct `up_long_edge` signal — not the `up_edge` that wakes the menu — so the two gestures never interfere.
* Because there is no dedicated Power button, the display power is toggled via a **LEFT long press while idle** (same gesture as exiting the menu, but triggered when the menu is already closed).
* If the touch rings react too sensitively or not at all, the threshold value `TOUCH_THRESHOLD` (default `25`) can be adjusted in `GLOBAL_DEFINES.h`. The idle reading is roughly 38–51 counts; a touched ring typically reads 4–8 counts.

## 8\. Hardware modifications

#### 8.1 PunkCyber IPS clock: No CH340 chip soldered on PCB of newer editions

##### Problem

**Short story**: CH340 chip is missing.

**Long story**: The original version of the "PunkCyber IPS Clock" was buyable from PCBWay as "RGB Glow Tube DIY Clock" and is no longer available from there (see [PCBWay | RGB Glow Clock](https://www.pcbway.com/project/gifts_detail/RGB_Glow_Tube_Clock_907ad35c.html)). This version had a CH340 chip soldered and two USB-C ports, where the right one was working, to communicate with a PC via the USB-UART chip.

The clock is still available to buy from other resellers. It is already assembled and in a box, sold as "PunkCyber IPS Clock".

All these newer versions of the clock do NOT have the CH340 chip and the components for the "auto download mode circuit" soldered! Just empty soldering header. So both USB-C ports are only for giving power to the clock.

A communication (like downloading or uploading firmware) is not possible easily without this chip!

The original manufacturer has an 'interesting' way to update the firmware "over-the-air", by connecting your mobile phone to the Wifi-Access-Point of the clock and joining a WeChat channel and let them control the clock from there (see the discussion on the PCBWay site).

##### Solution

If you want to bring the EleksTubeHAX firmware to the clock, we need either to solder a CH340 chip and the transistors and resistors on there designated places, or use an "external" USB-UART bridge/board.

Below the missing chip are some soldering headers:

![PunkCyber / RGB Glow tube](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_header.jpg)

##### Way 1 - External UART-USB adapter

The "easiser" way is the external board solution IMO.

BOOT is connected to GPIO0 (pin 25) on the ESP32 EN is connected to EN (pin 3) on the ESP32 G is connected to Ground (pins 1/38/15) on the ESP32 R is connected to GPIO1 / TxD (pin 35) on the ESP32 T is connected to GPIO3 / RxD (pin 34) on the ESP32

So we just need to connect G on the PCB to Ground on the UART bridge/board R on the PCB to Rx on the UART bridge/board T on the PCB to Tx on the UART bridge/board

| Pin PCB | Pin UART |
| --- | --- |
| G | GND |
| R | Rx |
| T | Tx |

We also need a way to put the clock into the download mode, so we need some kind of a switch between left header of BOOT 1 (to ESP32) and right header of BOOT 1 (Ground).

Best way is to solder "sockets" to the existing headers, so that there longer pin side is pointing downwards from the not printed side of the PCB. Reason is easy, there is enough space between the backplate and the PCB to leave them soldered on for re-usage and they are not visible from the upper side.

Soldered sockets:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets.jpg)

Soldered sockets with backplate:

![soldered sockets with backplate](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_soldered_sockets_with_backplate.jpg)

BOOT needs to be shorted, while the USB-C cable is connected to one of the USB-C ports (while powering) and then released to go into the download mode.

Normally, all USB-UART bridges/boards should work, but for me, the UART bridge mode of the Flipper Zero (STM chip) didn't work properly! I have no idea why.

So I successfully used an old FT232 board, which was still flying around (with Mini-USB :)) to read/backup the original firmware and write the EleksTubeHAX version.

To get one on your own, search for "USB to UART" on your favorite seller platform, like the ones with A from US or PRC. Costs should not exceed 2-7 EUR/USD.

Working solution:

![PunkCyber connected via FT232](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_connected_UART-USB_bridge_and_reset_button.jpg)

Successful backup:

![PunkCyber successfull backup](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_backup_successful.jpg)

Thanks to @Fastdruid for finding a good way to overcome this problem! See [Issue 62](https://github.com/aly-fly/EleksTubeHAX/issues/62).

##### Way 2 - Buy Missing Components and Solder Them

**Components needed:**

* 1× CH340C chip (SOP-16 package) - USB to UART converter
* 2× 10k Ohm SMD resistors (0805 format) - for auto-download circuit
* 2× 8050 transistors (SOT-23 package) - for auto-download circuit
* 1× 4.7nF SMD capacitor (50V - 0805 format) - decoupling capacitor

![PunkCyber Missing Components](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_components.jpg)

**Soldering notes:**

* All components are surface-mount (SMD) devices
* Recommended tools:
  * Solder paste
  * Hot air soldering station
* It is possible to solder these few components with a normal soldering iron and wire, but I would not recommend it.

![PunkCyber Soldered Components](/docs/ImagesMD/PunkCyber_PCB_CH340_soldered.jpg)

When properly soldered, the clock will be recognized as a virtual COM port when connected via USB-C to your computer.

#### 8.2 EleksTube Gen1: 5V on CH340 and ESP32

##### Problem

The "Original Version" (Gen1) of the EleksTube clock has a few issues in the hardware design. Most notably, it forces 5V signals from the USB-UART chip into the ESP32, which is not happy about it. This is outside of the safe operating limits and significantly reduces the lifetime of the ESP32. Mine (from the original author) died because of this...

##### Solution

The CH340 chip, used for USB-UART conversion, can operate both on 5V and 3.3V. On the Gen1 board it is powered by 5V. We can switch it to 3.3V. Cut one trace on the bottom side of the board that supplies the chip with 5V and route the 3.3V over the resistors / capacitors to VDD and VREF of the CH340.

![EleksStube Gen1 hardware modification](/docs/ImagesMD/EleksTube_IPS_CH340C_mod.jpg)

Note: This problem does not appear on Gen2 hardware from EleksTube! All clocks sold today (Autumn 2024) do not require any hardware modification!

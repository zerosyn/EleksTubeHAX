// ************* MQTT plain mode config *************
// #define MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED // Enable MQTT support for an external provider

// MQTT support is limited to what an external service offers (for example SmartNest.cz).
// You can use MQTT to control the clock via direct MQTT messages from external service or some DIY device.
// The actual MQTT implementation is "emulating" a temperature sensor, so you can use "set temperature" commands to control the clock from the SmartNest app.

// For plain MQTT support you can either use any internet-based MQTT broker (e.g., smartnest.cz or HiveMQ) or a local one (e.g., Mosquitto).
// If you choose an internet based one, you will need to create an account, (maybe setting up the device there) and filling in the data below then.
// If you choose a local one, you will need to set up the broker on your local network and fill in the data below.

#ifdef MQTT_PLAIN_ENABLED
#define MQTT_BROKER "smartnest.cz"                        // Broker host
#define MQTT_PORT 1883                                    // Broker port
#define MQTT_USERNAME "__enter_your_mqtt_username_here__" // Username from Smartnest
#define MQTT_PASSWORD "__enter_your_mqtt_password_here__" // Password from Smartnest or API key (under MY Account)
// #define MQTT_CLIENT_ID_FOR_SMARTNEST "__enter_your_device_id_here__"     // Device ID from Smartnest
#endif

// ************* MQTT HomeAssistant config *************
// #define MQTT_HOME_ASSISTANT // Uncomment if you want Home Assistant (HA) support

// You will either need a local MQTT broker to use MQTT with Home Assistant (e.g., Mosquitto) or use an internet-based broker with Home Assistant support.
// If not done already, you can set up a local one easily via an Add-On in HA. See: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/
// Enter the credential data into the MQTT broker settings section below accordingly.
// The device will send auto-discovery messages to Home Assistant via MQTT, so you can use the device in Home Assistant without any custom configuration needed.
// See https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mqtt/#discovery-messages-and-availability for more information.
// Retained messages can create ghost entities that keep coming back (i.e., if you change MQTT device name)! You need to delete them manually from the broker queue!

// Note that the following ACL may need to be set in Mosquitto in order to let the device access and write the necessary topics:
//   user <mqtt_username>
//   topic read homeassistant/status
//   pattern readwrite elekstubehax/%c/#
//   pattern readwrite homeassistant/+/%c/#

// --- MQTT broker settings ---
// Fill in the data according to configuration of your local MQTT broker that is linked to HomeAssistant - for example Mosquitto.
